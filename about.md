We are a growing research group based in Santiago, at the [Department of Physics][fisica-usach] in Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH). We are currently working on exciting problems at the interface between **chemical physics**, **quantum optics**, **materials science** and **quantum information**, using a variety of theoretical and computational  that we have developed or adopted to address these challenging problems.   

[Our group](/people/) is composed of Physics graduate students, as well as undergraduate students in Engineering Physics and Applied Mathematics. We also collaborate very closely with experimental groups in Nanoscience and Quantum Optics both in Chile and abroad.

We are always very happy to welcome motivated undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs with diverse backgrounds in all areas of science and engineering. If you are interested in joining our group, please check out our [current open positions](/openings/) to see if our work matches your interests. **If you have questions, we encourage you to contact us!**

For technical details about our work, we invite you to read about our current [research directions][research].

### About Felipe

Felipe obtained a BSc in Chemistry from Universidad de Chile in 2007. Together with his wife, he moved to beautiful Vancouver to carry out doctoral studies in the group of [Roman Krems][krems-website] at the University of British Columbia, where he obtained a [PhD in Chemistry][herrera-thesis] in 2012. After a brief joint postdoctoral position with Sabre Kais at Purdue University and Alán Aspuru-Guzik at Harvard University, he continued his postdoctoral work in the Aspuru-Guzik group. In 2014, Felipe was awarded a competitive Conicyt PAI grant to start his current independent research position at the [Department of Physics][fisica-usach] in USACH. For more information, please see [Felipe's CV][herrera-cv].

Felipe is also a husband and a father of a four-year old son who enjoys [stepping into his dad´s office][andres-photo] to teach him about anharmonic potential energy surfaces.
