Felipe obtained a BSc in Chemistry from Universidad de Chile in 2007. Together with his wife, he moved to beautiful Vancouver to carry out doctoral studies in the group of [Roman Krems][krems-website] at the University of British Columbia, where he obtained a [PhD in Chemistry][herrera-thesis] in 2012. After a brief joint postdoctoral position with [Sabre Kais][kais-website] at Purdue University and [Alán Aspuru-Guzik][alan-website] at Harvard University, he continued his postdoctoral work in the Aspuru-Guzik group. In 2014, Felipe was awarded a competitive Conicyt PAI grant to start his current independent research position at the [Department of Physics][fisica-usach] in USACH. For more information, please see [Felipe's CV][herrera-cv].

Felipe is also a husband and a father of a curious kid who enjoys [stepping into his dad´s office][andres-photo] to teach him about anharmonic potential energy surfaces.
