### Metal-Organic Frameworks for Quantum Communication

![MOF-SHG optical device][mof-shg]

Our group is currently developing *high-throughput virtual-screening* software using open-source RDKit tools together with in-house physical modelling, for the automated discovery of experimentally accessible single-crystal metal-organic frameworks (MOF) that can enable efficient second-harmonic generation (SHG) and spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). This computational material discovery effort expands our previous on the design of TiO<sub>2</sub> waveguides for third-order quantum nonlinear optics. 

In collaboration with the Nanosynthesis Laboratory of Dinesh Pratap Singh at USACH and Gustavo Lima at Universidad de Concepción, our goal is to **build a large-scale computational and synthetic capacity to develop new entangled photon sources and frequency doubling devices** based on high-quality MOF crystals.
