Our group is currently developing *high-throughput virtual-screening* software using open-source RDKit tools together with in-house physical modelling, for the automated discovery of experimentally accessible single-crystal metal-organic frameworks (MOF) that can enable efficient second-harmonic generation (SHG) and spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). This computational material discovery effort expands our previous work on the design of nanoscale nonlinear waveguides for third-order quantum nonlinear optics. 

In collaboration with the Nanosynthesis Lab of [Dinesh Pratap Singh][dinesh-scholar] at USACH and the Quantum Communication Lab of [Gustavo Lima][gustavo-scholar] at Universidad de Concepción, our goal is to **build a large-scale computational and synthetic capacity to develop new entangled photon sources and frequency doubling devices** based on high-quality MOF crystals.

This research direction is one of the four focus topic of the [Millenium Institute for Research in Optics][miro-icm-site] MIRO.
