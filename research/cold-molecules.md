![Laser driven polar molecules in an optical lattice][lattice-image]

Atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics is at the core of all our research activities. We have studied a number of coherent control schemes designed to manipulate ultracold atomic and molecular collisions using electric and magnetic fields in optical traps, proposing a solution to the well-known difficulty of achieving coherent control of two-body processes via path-interference. We have also studied the collective dynamics of cold polar molecules in optical lattices with tunable phonons arising from the long-range dipole-dipole interactions induced by static electric fields, proposing **the first** quantum simulator of **Holstein polaron physics** beyond the conventional regimes commonly found in condensed-matter systems. We have also shown that open-shell polar molecules in optical lattices can be used to implement **universal two-qubit quantum gates** with single-site resolution using static magnetic fields and far-detuning near-infrared lasers. 

We are currently exploring novel sympathetic cooling schemes based on laser-driven atom-molecule collisions between ultracold Rydberg-dressed atoms and polar polyatomic molecules in three-dimensional dipole traps. Designing a general realistic scheme for bringing polyatomic molecules from the millikelvin regime to the microkelvin regime without would allow researchers to explore new cold molecule physics and chemistry.
