Our group is developing new theoretical and numerical frameworks to study the complex quantum dynamics of organic materials embedded in optical and infrared optical cavities, in order to address outstanding questions and propose new experiments in the emerging field of organic cavity quantum electrodynamics.

One of our goals is to theoretically construct robust quantum control schemes for the manipulation of optical, electronic and vibrational processes in organic molecular samples under strong and ultrastrong intracavity light-matter coupling. Our current efforts are  focused on **manipulating chemical reactions** and  **nonlinear optical properties** of organic materials, using quantum optics and quantum control techniques.

We are also very actively developing efficient numerical methods to solve the complex internal quantum dynamics of organic cavities in the strong coupling regime, in order to realistically simulate experimental cavity observables such as the emission spectrum for arbitrary driving strength, the rates of chemical reactions and the nonlinear propagation of optical signals.
