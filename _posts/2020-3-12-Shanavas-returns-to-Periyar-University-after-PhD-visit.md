![Farewell Shanavas][farewell-shanavas]

This week we said farwell to our first PhD visitor **Shanavas Shajahan**, a 4th year PhD student in the Department of Physics at Periyar University (India). Shanavas was co-hosted between us and Dinesh Singh's Lab since June 2019. He leaves Chile after successfully carrying out several experiments on the physics of metal-organic frameworks for applications in energy storage. We wish Shanavas the best for the rest of his PhD studies and hope to see him back in our labs soon. **Farewell Shanavas!**
