We are very happy that our invited Perspective "[Molecular polaritons for controlling chemistry with quantum optics](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5136320)", with Jeffrey Owrutsky from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, became one of the most read articles in The Journal of Chemical Physics in 2020. 

We are grateful for the positive feedback received from experts and students who are using this Perspective article to familiarize themselves with the field.
