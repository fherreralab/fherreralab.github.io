**Welcome to the group Bastián!**

We are very happy that Bastían Martínez is joining our group as a fellow of the "*IV Fondo Concursable de la Facultad de Ciencia*" for undergraduate research. Bastían is pursuing a BSc degree in Computer Science at USACH, and he will join our incipient efforts on machine learning for physics.
