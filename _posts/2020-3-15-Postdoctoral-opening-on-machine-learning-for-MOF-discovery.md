We are pleased to offer a postdoctoral position on **machine learning for materials discovery**, with applications in optical quantum communication. 

The position is available for up to **three-years** in our Molecular Quantum Technology Group, based in the Department of Physics at Universidad de Santiago de Chile. The group currently works on the development of large-scale virtual screening algorithms for the computational discovery of experimentally-accesible metal-organic frameworks (MOF) that can be used as efficient nonlinear optical crystals for quantum communication protocols. In this project, we collaborate very closely with experimental groups on nanomaterials synthesis, laser spectroscopy, and quantum optics. 

Applicants must submit their **CV** and have **2 letters of recommendation** sent to **felipe.herrera.u@usach.cl**. We will Skype interview all eligible aplicants. 

**Application Deadline: July 15, 2020**. 
The start date is flexible, but no later than January 1st, 2021. 


# Duties: 

* To collaborate effectively with current group members on data representation and generative modelling for the discovery of metal-organic framework materials for quantum key distribution with entangled photon pairs. 

* Assist in scientific training of physics and chemistry undergraduate students. 

* Lead the preparation of grant proposals and scientific publications. 


# Requirements: 

Ph.D. degree in Computer Science, Chemistry, Physics, Applied Mathematics, and related fields. **Demonstrated experience with unsupervised machine learning techniques for applications in science and/or engineering** (e.g. generative modeling), preferably with moderate-size datasets. Excellent programming skills in scientific computing languages (e.g. Python, R, Matlab). Experience or familiarity with chemoinformatics for structure-property prediction *and/or* high-throughput virtual screening techniques is an asset.

We welcome applications of recent graduates from all backgrounds. **Travel Support is provided for accepted international applicants**.
