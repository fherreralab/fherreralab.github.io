We are happy to announce that Katy Arauchan joins us to become the first PhD student in the group! Katy received his BSc degree in Physics at Universidad de CÃ³rdova in Colombia (2017), and since then she has been dedicated to physics and science teaching. After being admitted to the PhD Physics program in our Department, she joined our group to carry out research at the interface of quantum optics, AMO physics and chemical physics. We are thrilled to welcome her and look forward to see her make progress on her research projects. 

**Welcome to the group Katy!**
