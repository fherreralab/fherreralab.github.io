We are happy to announce that the Millenium Institute for Research in Optics (MIRO) will host in Chile the *1st international workshop on the emerging topic of molecular quantum technology*. The meeting will take place late 2019, and will bring together leading experts in the fields of quantum control, condensed-matter physics, quantum optics, molecular and chemical physics who are actively looking for ways to exploit molecules and molecular materials for the development of novel quantum technology.
