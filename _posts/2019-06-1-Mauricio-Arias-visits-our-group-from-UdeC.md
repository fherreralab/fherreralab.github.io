Mauricio comes from Universidad de Concepci√≥n (UdeC) and works under supervision of Aldo Delgado on quantum information theory. During his stay with us, Mauricio is working on collective coherent effects during chemical reactions in molecular ensembles inside optical microcavities. **Welcome to our group Mauricio!**
