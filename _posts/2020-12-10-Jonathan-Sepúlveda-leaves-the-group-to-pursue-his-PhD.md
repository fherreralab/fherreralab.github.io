**Farewell Jonathan Sepúlveda.**

Jonathan was admitted as a graduate student at Universidad del País Vasco (Spain) and the Materials Physics Center  (San Sebastian), to pursue PhD studies in physics, working on theoretical quantum nanophotonics under the supervision of [Javier Aizpurua](https://cfm.ehu.es/team/javier-aizpurua-iriazabal/). We wish Jonathan a successfull and productive PhD experience. 

Jonathan joined our group in 2015 as an undergraduate research student, defended his BSc Engineering Physics thesis on Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations for optical nanoantennas in 2018, and then continued with us to pursue a MSc degree in physics. He successfully defended his MSc thesis on computational macroscopic quantum electrodynamics for applications in strong light-matter coupling phenomena, which ultimately helped him get accepted in his PhD program.  

**Well done Jonathan!**
