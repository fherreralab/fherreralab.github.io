*We are happy to welcome Ruben Fritz to join our group as our first postdoctoral researcher!*

Ruben received his PhD from Universidad de Talca this year 2018, working on computational biology. He will help us accelerate our development of large-scale virtual screening algorithms for the computational discovery of experimentally-accesible metal-organic frameworks (MOF) that can be used as efficient nonlinear optical crystals for quantum communication protocols.
