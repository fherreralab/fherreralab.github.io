The Millenium Scientific Initiative ([ICM][ICM-site]) at the Chilean Ministry of Economy published the results of the 2017 competition to create two new Millenium Institutes in Chile, and we are happy to announce that our proposed Millenium Institute for Research in Optics (MIRO) was recommended to receive funding of **US$ 1.600.000** per year for up to **10 years**, to pursue cutting-edge research in key areas of experimental and theoretical optical science. 

A few new [Millenium Institutes][institutos-milenio] are selected each year by an accomplished international scientific committee after a competitive process with rigorous [evaluation criteria][criterios-milenio]. 

Our Lab is proud to become one of co-founding partners of [MIRO][miro-icm-site]. In very close collaboration with the Nanosynthesis Lab led by [Dinesh Pratap Singh][dinesh-scholar] at USACH and the Quantum Cryptography Lab led by [Gustavo Lima][gustavo-scholar] at Universidad de Concepci√≥n, we are **computationally designing, fabricating and testing new optical materials** based on [metal-organic frameworks](/research/mof-nlo/) (MOF),  as novel sources of non-classical light to be used in entanglement-based quantum communication protocols.
