Our postdocs Johan Triana and Federico Hern치ndez won the prestigious Fondecyt Postdoctoral Fellowship with their proposals on molecular polariton physics and chemistry under strong and ultrastrong light-matter coupling. These are semi-independent research projects sponsored by our group. 

The Fondecyt Postdoctoral Fellowship offers a generous stipend for up to 3 years (2020-2023), and provides funds for international travel, and minor research expenses.  

**Congratulations Johan and Federico for this accomplishment!**
