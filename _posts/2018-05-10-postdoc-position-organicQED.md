A **fully-funded** postdoctoral position in **quantum dynamics of organic materials in optical cavities** is available for **two-years** at the Molecular Quantum Technology Group of Felipe Herrera. The position will be held in the Department of Physics at Universidad de Santiago de Chile. The Herrera Lab works on the development of novel theoretical and numerical frameworks to study the complex quantum dynamics of organic materials embedded in optical and infrared optical cavities, in order to address outstanding questions and propose new experiments in the emerging field of organic cavity quantum electrodynamics.

Applicants must send their **current CV and 2 letters of recommendation** to *felipe.herrera.u@usach.cl*. 

**Application Deadline: June 15, 2018**.


# Duties: 

* Lead group efforts to develop efficient numerical methods for solving the complex internal quantum dynamics of organic cavities in the strong and ultrastrong coupling regime, for simulation of experimental observables such as the emission spectrum, the rates of chemical reactions and the nonlinear propagation of optical signals.

* Assist in scientific training of physics and chemistry undergraduate students. 

* Assist in the preparation of grant proposals and scientific publications. 


# Requirements: 

Ph.D. degree in Chemistry, Physics or similar. Demonstrated knowledge of theoretical and numerical methods for studying quantum dynamics of atomic or molecular systems subject to external driving and dissipation. Good programming skills in scientific computing languages (e.g. Python, Fortran, Matlab). Familiarity with cavity QED theory *and/or* molecular quantum dynamics is a plus.

We welcome applications from all sections of the community and from people of all backgrounds.
