*We welcome Joan Triana as the 3rd postdoc to join our group.*

Johan received his PhD in Physics from Universidad de Antioquia (Colombia) in 2019, working on quantum dynamics of diatomic molecules in quantum optical cavities, using exact numerical methods including Multi Configuration Time Dependent Hartree (MCTDH). His work with us will focus on controlling chemistry with quantum optics in infrared and optical cavities.
