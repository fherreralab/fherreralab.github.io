We are a theory group in the Department of Physics at Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH). We are working on exciting problems at the interface between <span style="color: #002bac">chemical physics, quantum optics, materials science and quantum information</span>, using a variety of theoretical and computational tools. 


## Current Research

Our research efforts are currently focused on the following topics:


[**Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Organic Materials**][organic-qed]


[**Metal-Organic Frameworks for Quantum Communication**][mof-nlo]


[**Quantum Control with Ultracold Molecules**][cold-molecules]
