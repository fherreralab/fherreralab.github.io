title: Molecular Quantum Technology Group
---

We are a theory group in the Department of Physics at Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH). We are working on exciting problems at the interface between **chemical physics**, **quantum optics**, **materials science** and **quantum information**, using a variety of theoretical and computational tools that we have developed to address challenging research problems. Our group is currently focused on three main research topics:


[Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Organic Materials][organic-qed]


[Metal-Organic Frameworks for Quantum Communication][mof-nlo]


[Quantum Control with Ultracold Molecules][cold-molecules]


We are always very happy to welcome motivated undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs with diverse backgrounds in all areas of science and engineering. If you are interested in joining our group, please check out our [current open positions](/openings/) to see if our work matches your interests. Our group is diverse and we all do our best to make everyone's experience in the lab as **enjoyable and fruitful** as possible.
