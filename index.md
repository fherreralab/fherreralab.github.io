title: Molecular Quantum Technology Group
---

We are a growing research group based in Santiago, at the [Department of Physics][fisica-usach] in Universidad de Santiago de Chile (USACH). We are currently working on exciting problems at the interface between **chemical physics**, **quantum optics**, **materials science** and **quantum information**, using a variety of theoretical and computational tools that we have developed to address challenging research problems.   

[Our group](/people/) is composed of Physics graduate students, as well as undergraduate students in Engineering Physics and Applied Mathematics. We also collaborate very closely with experimental groups in Nanoscience and Quantum Optics both in Chile and internationally.

We are always very happy to welcome motivated undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs with diverse backgrounds in all areas of science and engineering. If you are interested in joining our group, please check out our [current open positions](/openings/) to see if our work matches your interests. Our group is diverse and we all do our best to make everyone's experience in the lab as **enjoyable and fruitful** as possible. 

To learn more about our work, we invite you to read a description of our current [research directions](/research-areas/) and our list of [publications](/publications/).
