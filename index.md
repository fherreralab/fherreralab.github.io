We are a [group](/people/) of theoretical and computational researchers working on exciting problems at the interface between **chemical physics**, **quantum optics**, **materials science** and **quantum information**. To learn more about our work, we invite you to read about current [research directions](/research-areas/) and [publications](/publications/).

We are always excited to meet and welcome motivated students and postdocs. If you are interested in join our group, please check out our [current openings](/openings/). Our group is diverse and we all do our best to make everyone's experience in the lab as **enjoyable and fruitful** as possible.
