The [Millenium Institute for Research in Optics][MIRO] (MIRO) is a government-funded collaboration between researchers at five Chilean universities dedicated to study fundamental and applied science enabled by classical and quantum optics. 

# Novel Quantum Light Sources
 
In collaboration with the Nanosynthesis Laboratory led by [Prof. Dinesh Singh][dinesh-scholar] (USACH) and the Quantum Communication Laboratory of [Prof. Gustavo Lima][gustavo-scholar] (UdeC), our group is contributing to the development of [novel sources of entangled photons based on *metal-organic framework* materials][mof-nlo]. 

Quantum light can be used to implement:

 - quantum key distribution for secure communications. 
 - fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.
 - spectroscopic measurements beyond the standard quantum limit of precision.
 - protocols for multi-dimensional quantum information processing.
